title: Wheel Chair and Bench

The girl on a bench asked with a smirk,  
"So? Were you paying attention?"  

I said, "yea.." as I looked at her again with a faint smile on my face.  

This moment at night in which everything is the same except that there is the garden girl outside the hospital looking at the stars.

It is certainly heart warming to see the garden girl in a wheelchair after all these years.

The girl seemed like she was happy being outside with the guy who looked after her for years.

However, she couldn't get the small confusion off of her face. After all, the boy grew up so much that he looks like a different person now.

"Well.. It's all good now", I said in a quiet, calm voice.

"What was that?", A fierce voice has pierced through my eardrums.

"I hope this moment lasts forever", I said it only to realize how cheesy it sounds.

"W-what are you saying, you shameless fool!", the girl on a bench turned her head to the otherside of the river. 

I could see her blush.

"Not bad at all."

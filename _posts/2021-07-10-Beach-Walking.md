I don't know how long it has been.

Since I joined this social club, I have experienced so many new things I would never have imagined doing by myself.

The sun was setting faster than my perceived speed of thought and I was standing here infront of her, patiently waiting for me looked all worried.

I had to say something because the atmosphere was getting heavier than ever.

"I am sorry for keeping you await for so long. I just wanted to say.."

To be honest, I didn't have to say anything to her.   Afterall, all of us were having so much fun.  

However, I knew this was inevitable, and I had to make this decision before it's too late.

"It's time for me to go... go back to my old life."  

As I finished the statement, I could see her expression getting depressingly sad.  
This moment will throw a pebble to the calm little puddle we had and eventually make a pulse of distrust and discord.  

I don't know if I am going to be completely okay after all of this, but I know for sure that I will be able to see them in the future, share what happened afterwards, as an old friend.

She turned and walked away without saying anything.. just like the day of our first meeting.  

"Farewell."
